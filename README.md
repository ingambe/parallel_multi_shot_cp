# A Parallel Multi-Shot Decomposition Strategy for Large-Scale Job-Shop Scheduling

search decomposition strategy for scheduling problems, which involves breaking the problem into $N$ overlapping windows and optimizing them in parallel using a CP solver.
This approach enables efficient and straightforward parallel and distributed processing, which is crucial for solving large-scale scheduling problems.
